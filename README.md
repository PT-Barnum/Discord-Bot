# About
 This is a personal project I like to develop and debug in my freetime. I have found the numerous libraries within the Python 3 language
 have made for a more straightforward approach to creating new commands and cogs. The code for this bot will be prone to SUBSTANTIAL changes
 as I decide upon different features I want the bot to support. Portions of the code are borrowed from other discord bots found on Github and
 other resources which are noted in respective comments to the given command.
